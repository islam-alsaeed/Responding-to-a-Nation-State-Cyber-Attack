# Responding-to-a-Nation-State-Cyber-Attack

<h2>What Are We Doing?</h2>

<b>South Udan</b> is a small island nation that is a peaceful and technologically advanced nation! Because of its small size, the country believes in efficiently using its land and natural resources. Their scientists recently came up with a novel and cleaner means of performing nuclear fission of an element called Tridanium. This allows them to generate 100 times more energy and drastically reduce nuclear waste, thus making it the most efficient and clean way to generate electricity. This enabled them to generate cleaner and cheaper electricity, thus improving the lives of their citizens.

<b>North Udan</b> was extremely jealous of the progress of their neighbors. They still rely on using coal and other fossil fuels which are known to speed up global warming. In order to disrupt South Udan program, the government of North Udan decides to launch a cyberattack on South Udan Tridanium processing plant and disrupt its operation. 

<b>The National Peace Agency of North Udan</b>, which is an undercover organization that runs the nation-state espionage program, launches an attack during a national holiday in South Udan (the holiday marks 50 years of border separation of the two nations). They manage to compromise a linux server which serves as a jump host to connect the Tridanium processing plant to the internet. They attempted to brute force the password of an employee account which triggered a security alarm. You have been immediately called onboard to respond to the security alarm and contain the ongoing cyberattack. You will begin the investigation from the compromised jump box to detect and mitigate the threats. Since it's a mission-critical server, you are also tasked with immediately hardening the server to proactively defeat future attacks from North Udan.
